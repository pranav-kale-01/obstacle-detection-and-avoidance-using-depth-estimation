# Obstacle Detection and Alerting using 3D Depth Estimation

## Device Overview

This project involves building a hardware system using various components like the ESP32 board with a camera, audio amplifier, and more. The system is designed to retrieve the camera feeds from ESP32 Camera and utizing the stream to our detection pipeline.

## Hardware Components

- **ESP32 Board with Camera**
  - A microcontroller with integrated WiFi and Bluetooth, along with a camera for capturing images.
- **MAX98357 12S Amplifier**
  - A digital audio amplifier that converts digital audio signals to analog output for a speaker.
- **Small Speaker**

  - Outputs the audio signals processed by the amplifier.

- **HiLetgo FT232RL Mini USB to TTL Serial Converter**

  - Allows for serial communication between the ESP32 and a computer via USB.

- **Adapter**

  - Provides power supply to the hardware components.

- **Battery (Lithium-Ion)**

  - Powers the entire system, ensuring portability.

- **Antenna (WiFi 2.4G to 5.8 3dbi PCB)**

  - Enhances the WiFi signal reception for the ESP32 board.

- **Battery Charger Module (TP4056 Micro USB 5V 1A 18650)**
  - Charges the Lithium-Ion battery safely and efficiently.
